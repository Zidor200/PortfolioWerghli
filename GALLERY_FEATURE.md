# Gallery Button Feature

## Overview
Added a "View Full Gallery" button that takes users to a dedicated page displaying all 100 photos in a grid layout with gaps between them.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Gallery Button Locations**

#### Location 1: Top of Interactive Gallery Section
- Button appears next to the "Interactive Gallery Experience" heading
- Text: "View Full Gallery →"
- Styling: Dark gray button with hover effects and shadow

#### Location 2: Inside Interactive Gallery Container
- Button appears at the bottom center of the 3D gallery
- Text: "View All Photos Gallery →"
- Styling: Semi-transparent black with white border, inverts on hover
- Stops propagation to prevent interfering with gallery navigation

### 2. **Full Gallery View**

When the gallery button is clicked:
- Shows ALL 100 photos in a responsive grid layout
- Grid adapts to screen size:
  - Mobile: 2 columns
  - Small tablets: 3 columns
  - Medium screens: 4 columns
  - Large screens: 5 columns
  - Extra large: 6 columns
- Each photo has gaps (spacing) between them
- Photos maintain aspect ratio (square)
- Includes "Back to Portfolio" button to return

### 3. **Navigation Flow**

```
Portfolio Section
    ↓ (Click "View Full Gallery" button)
Full Gallery Page (All 100 photos in grid)
    ↓ (Click "← Back to Portfolio" button)
Portfolio Section (returns to original view)
```

### 4. **Technical Implementation**

#### State Management
- Uses React `useState` to toggle between views
- No React Router needed (simple state-based approach)

#### Smooth Transitions
- Auto-scrolls to top when switching views
- 100ms delay for smooth transition
- Uses `window.scrollTo()` with smooth behavior

#### Performance
- Full gallery uses lazy loading (already implemented)
- Only loads images as they come into viewport
- Maintains all previous optimizations
